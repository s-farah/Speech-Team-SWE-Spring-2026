"""
transcribe.py - mic input & transcription

We use Vosk for offline, low-latency speech recognition
Audio goes directly from the mic into Vosk 

Partial results are checked mid-speech so commands start ASAP w/o waiting for silence
Only the first word of each partial is passed and duplication prevention in commands.py handles repeats

test w/o robot:
    python transcribe.py
    expect single words printed instantly 

Dependencies:
    pip install vosk sounddevice
    Unzip vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15 into the voice_control folder.
